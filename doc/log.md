Started the project.   CoffeeSociety's internet connection went down, so I could create the PyUI
repository there.   Still, the first step is an exercise in getting the system running.   I don't
expect to use docker on this until later.

Added a basic makefile to have blank tests that pass.  First step.

Need to start a module I guess.

Spent an hour on devEnv again.   Still can't get pylint doing the right thing.

Linked a readme to the plan doc.  Made a simple integration test, but no test yet.

starting.
